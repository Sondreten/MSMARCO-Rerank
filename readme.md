# MS MACRO Group Project Team-013

Here you will find our implementation for the MS MARCO re-ranking 2020 task. This project was part of our evaluation and project work in DAT640-1 20H Information Retrieval and Text Mining. This implementation are using a feature based traditional machine learning approach to this problem.
This was a group project, created by Sondre Tenn√∏, Einar Langholm, Anthony Ibeme.

## Dataset

To run this code, you will need to download all neccessary datasets from the official MS MARCO website: https://microsoft.github.io/msmarco/

and from the github: https://github.com/microsoft/MSMARCO-Document-Ranking

## Code

All of our code in this project are in one single jupyter notebook file, 'MSmarco_013.ipynb'.
Going through each section as they were implemented, download libraries, indexing, gathering trainingdata, gathering dev and test sets, evaluation, baseline, advanced model.

## Paper

To contemplate the code, we have written a paper regarding our implementation of our re-ranking models. What approaches we have chosen and why we did certain things.
The paper can be found in this github repository as 'Team_013.pdf'.
